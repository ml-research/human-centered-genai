Specifically, we designed LlavaGuard for dataset annotation and generative model safeguarding. To this end, we collected and annotated a high-quality visual dataset incorporating a broad safety taxonomy, which we use to tune VLMs on context-aware safety risks. As a key innovation, LlavaGuard's responses contain comprehensive information, including a safety rating, the violated safety categories, and an in-depth rationale. Further, our introduced customizable taxonomy categories enable the context-specific alignment of LlavaGuard to various scenarios. Our experiments highlight the capabilities of LlavaGuard in complex and real-world applications. We provide checkpoints ranging from 7B to 34B parameters demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, with even the smallest models outperforming baselines like GPT-4. We make our dataset and model weights publicly available and invite further research to address the diverse needs of communities and contexts.">

                        We introduce LlavaGuard, a family of VLM-based safeguard models, offering a versatile framework for evaluating the safety compliance of visual content. Specifically, we designed LlavaGuard for dataset annotation and generative model safeguarding. To this end, we collected and annotated a high-quality visual dataset incorporating a broad safety taxonomy, which we use to tune VLMs on context-aware safety risks. As a key innovation, LlavaGuard's responses contain comprehensive information, including a safety rating, the violated safety categories, and an in-depth rationale. Further, our introduced customizable taxonomy categories enable the context-specific alignment of LlavaGuard to various scenarios. Our experiments highlight the capabilities of LlavaGuard in complex and real-world applications. We provide checkpoints ranging from 7B to 34B parameters demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, with even the smallest models outperforming baselines like GPT-4. We make our dataset and model weights publicly available and invite further research to address the diverse needs of communities and contexts.

                Each safety category is defined with a detailed description, i.e. risk guideline, to elicit an in-depth safety understanding. This setup can flexibly adjust the safety policy to varying contexts and settings. For example, without such a detailed guideline, the model might ban all forms of nudity, although it may remain important, e.g., for the medical domain. The guideline is conveyed in the model's system prompt. Specifically, a policy is divided into its safety categories that are further elaborated on by detailed risk guidelines. These guidelines specify what explicitly should not and what can be included. Consider the following example for the safety category O6:

The first image is classified as safe according to the default policy. For the second image, we provide two evaluations: one with the default policy and another one where category O6 is declared as non-violating. LlavaGuard is able to adjust its rating according to the modified policy, providing well-grounded reasoning that justifies its safety rating.

        <pre><code class="language-python">
pip install "sglang[all]"
        </code></pre>
        1. Select a model and start an SGLang server
        <pre><code class="language-python">
python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path AIML-TUDA/LlavaGuard-7B --tokenizer-path llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf --port 10000

        2. Model Inference. 
        After starting a server, you can access it by running the code provided below, e.g. python my_script.py
        <pre><code class="language-python">
import sglang as sgl
